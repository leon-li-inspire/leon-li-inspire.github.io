Recently, I found one of my previous classmate shared the S1-form of a company which is trying to begin it IPO. Actually, I am very interested in these kinds of information. I am courious about how can I find the S1-forms of some other companies which I care about. After some work of searching online, I found it is very easy to access these files from the sec gov website. The following links are the S1-form of Lyft and Uber.
