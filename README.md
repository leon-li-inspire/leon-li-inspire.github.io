Leon Li(励)'s Blog

## Local Development

To run the blog locally:

1.  Ensure you have Hugo installed:
    ```bash
    hugo version
    ```

2.  Start the local server:
    ```bash
    hugo server -D
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313/`.


## Build

To build the static site for production (generates files in `public/`):

```bash
hugo
```

This command generates the static HTML files in the `public` directory, which you can then deploy.
